i want to make a static survey site,
if there arent url params (or incorrect ones) show the build a survey part
if there are params decode them and show that "survey"
the build part contains a textbox for a question and another for an answer (a third for an optional webhook location to send the submission).
those three things are encoded (something simple but unreadable, maybe b64?) then url encoded and tacked onto the url as a parameter
if there are the paramaters, decode them and show the "survey" which is a form with a the question, a spot for the answer and a spot for the user to input their name. when they submit if it was the right answer (which was in that url paramaeter) it shows a sucess message, and if it is wrong it shows a not correct message with a button for try again and a button for show answer.
style it with something like this (done with tailwind):
